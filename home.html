                    <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
                    <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
                    <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
                    <li>The first player to score 100 or more points wins. </li>
